-   Start with clear instructions
-   Use few-shot learning
-   Repeat instructions at the end
-   Prime the output
-   Add clear syntax

reliable sources of information, do not fabricate any facts, and cite your sources.
If unsure, express that you do not know. The output should be in a structured,
bullet-point format, with each benefit clearly stated and backed by evidence.

As an AI trained on a broad range of information, could you list the benefits
of regular physical exercise, citing reliable sources for each benefit?
